# NouVet

NouVet is an app for pet owners. The project has been created with the goal of building a web application that maximizes the value to the users while remaining as cheap as possible.

- Deployed on Free-tier service providers, remain Open Source according to terms of usage of the provider.
- Ready for change. For example, SQLite is limited in its core, allowing to move to a different Database if there's a better opportunity. Although I don't think I'll think about it until this gets users.
- The project has a [license](./LICENSE), the main purpose of which is to convey my attitude to copying the project. I don't append a license text to each source file, but I expect the source of the copy to be included, and remain open sourced. This will make me happy.
