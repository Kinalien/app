# Popover

Uses [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) and [CSS Anchor Positioning](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api).

Known bugs:

- [ ] When tabbing backwards from popover to the trigger, popover won't close. This is acceptable, as the popover can still be light-dismissed with <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
